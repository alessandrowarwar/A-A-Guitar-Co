  "excerpt": "A behind-the-scenes look at how we added a user-friendly light/dark mode toggle to our site.",
  "content": "<p>For Part One, I wanted users to easily switch between light and dark modes. I wrote a <code>changeMode()</code> JavaScript function that toggles the <code>darkMode</code> and <code>lightMode</code> classes on the <code>body</code> element. I placed the toggle button in the navbar for visibility on every page. The function also updates the logo and icon images based on the mode. To remember the user's preference, I used cookies and checked them on page load to set the correct mode. In my CSS, I used selectors like <code>.darkMode</code> to change colors, backgrounds, and button styles for dark mode. One challenge was making sure the toggle button itself didn't get the dark mode button styling, so I excluded it with <code>:not(.changeScreenModeIcon)</code> in my CSS. This made the switch seamless and visually consistent across the site.</p>",

  "excerpt": "How we made our blog section dynamic using JSON and JavaScript.",
  "content": "<p>For Part Two, I wanted the blog to be easy to update without editing HTML. I created a <code>Posts.json</code> file to store all blog post data as an array of objects. Each object contains fields like <code>id</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>author</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>excerpt</code>, and <code>content</code>. In my JavaScript, I used <code>fetch()</code> to load <code>Posts.json</code> and then looped through the posts to generate HTML for each one. I inserted the generated HTML into the blog container on the page. This lets me add or edit posts just by updating the JSON file. I also added logic to only display posts where <code>published</code> is <code>true</code>. This approach keeps the blog scalable and easy to maintain, and separates content from layout and logic.</p>",
